## ⚙️ BATCH GENERATION STRATEGY

### Method 1: Stable Diffusion (BEST)
1. Copy all prompts into a `.txt` file
2. Use "Batch from file" feature in SD Web UI
3. Set output to 16x16 resolution
4. Generate all at once (takes 30-60 minutes for 80+ textures)
5. Use "img2img" to refine any poor results

### Method 2: Daily Batches (Free Tier Services)
**Day 1**: Fire + Water dimension textures (12-15 images)
**Day 2**: Earth + Air dimension textures (12-15 images)
**Day 3**: Celestial + Void dimension textures (12-15 images)
**Day 4**: Dream + Fungal dimension textures (12-15 images)
**Day 5**: Archive + Astral dimension textures (12-15 images)
**Day 6**: Gloom dimension + item essences (12-15 images)
**Day 7**: Refinements and retries

### Method 3: Mixed Approach
- Use **Bing Creator** for most important textures (dimension stones, essences)
- Use **Stable Diffusion** for bulk generation (all ores, custom blocks)
- Use **Leonardo.ai** for retries and variants

---

## 🔧 POST-GENERATION PROCESSING

After generating textures:

1. **Resize** all images to exactly 16x16 pixels (use any image editor)
2. **Remove backgrounds** if not transparent (use remove.bg or GIMP)
3. **Rename files** to match the guide (e.g., `inferno_stone.png`)
4. **Place in folders**:
   - Blocks → `ResourcePack_ElementalDimensions/assets/elementaldimensions/textures/block/`
   - Items → `ResourcePack_ElementalDimensions/assets/elementaldimensions/textures/item/`

---

## 📦 AUTOMATION TOOLS

**Bulk Processing**:
- **ImageMagick** (command-line): Convert/resize all at once
- **XnConvert** (GUI): Batch resize, rename, format convert
- **GIMP** (Script-Fu): Automate transparency and resize

**Example ImageMagick Command** (resize all to 16x16):
```bash
magick mogrify -resize 16x16! -format png *.png
```

---

## ✅ FINAL CHECKLIST

Before using textures:
- [ ] All textures are exactly 16x16 pixels
- [ ] File format is PNG
- [ ] Backgrounds are transparent (for items)
- [ ] File names match TEXTURE_GUIDE.md
- [ ] Files are in correct folders
- [ ] Test in-game (use F3+T to reload resource pack)

---

## 🎯 SUMMARY

**Recommended Path**:
1. Install **Stable Diffusion Web UI** locally
2. Download a pixel art model from CivitAI
3. Use the prompts above in batch mode
4. Generate all 80+ textures in one session
5. Post-process with ImageMagick or XnConvert
6. Copy to resource pack folders
7. Test in-game

**Alternative Path** (if no local PC):
1. Use **Bing Image Creator** daily
2. Generate 15-20 textures per day over 6 days
3. Manually resize to 16x16 in any image editor
4. Save with correct names
5. Upload to resource pack

**Good luck! 🚀 With AI generation, you can have all textures done in under 2 hours!**
